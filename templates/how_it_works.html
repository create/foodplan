<h1>How it Works:</h1>

<h4>Pantry simplifies meal planning by doing it for you: balancing your nutrition needs with your budget and recommended portions from each food group.</h4>


<h4>1. Enter basic information, like how many people you cook for.</h4>
<h4>2. Instantly get your meals assigned to you. (Customize them afterwards if you want).</h4>
<h4>3. Get your weekly shopping list on Evernote.</h4>


<h2>Welcome to a simpler life.</h2>
